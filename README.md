# IPMenuBar

> Needed something like this to make my life a little easier so instead of downloading already existing one I created yet another one...

`IPMenuBar` is a simple macOS menu bar application that displays the user's IP address. It provides two modes for retrieving the IP address: `Public IP` and `Local IP`.

## Modes

### Public IP

In `Public IP` mode, `IPMenuBar` fetches the public IP address of the user's network connection using the [`ipify`](https://www.ipify.org) API. 

### Local IP

In `Local IP` mode, `IPMenuBar` retrieves the local IP address of the user's device within the local network. It scans the network interfaces of the device and identifies the IP address assigned to the active network interface.

## Install

Download IPMenuBar.zip file containing IPMenuBar.app from [latest release](https://github.com/janekbaraniewski/IPMenuBar/releases/).
